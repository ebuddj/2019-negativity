## What are European Countries' Issues (EBU)

This visualization shows the status on European countries according to seven data variables:

* General government gross debt
* Government bond yields
* Greenhouse gas emissions
* Infant mortality rate
* Low satisfaction
* Underachieving students
* Unemployment by sex and age

This so called "spider web" visualization shows more red for countries which are not perfoming in the categories.

The data comes from various statistics gathered and provided by the Eurostat.
